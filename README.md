lnu-suite â€” Linux Network Utility Suite
A polished, Linux-first CLI toolset (Python, C++, Bash) for system monitoring, concurrent TCP port scanning, and process management. Designed to showcase practical systems and networking skills.

This project is designed for Linux environments. macOS users can run the Python scripts, but the C++ utility requires a Linux system (e.g., via Docker) to function correctly.

WARNING
Only run network scans against hosts you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning may be illegal.

Features
System Monitor (lnu/monitor.py): Samples CPU, memory, disk, and network I/O at set intervals. Logs snapshots to a newline-delimited JSON (.jsonl) file with graceful shutdown handling and simple log rotation.

TCP Scanner (lnu/scan.py): A concurrent port scanner using a ThreadPoolExecutor for high performance. Features configurable workers, connection timeouts, basic banner grabbing, and JSON report generation.

Process Manager (cpp/lnu_proc.cpp): A C++ utility for Linux systems that lists running processes by parsing the /proc filesystem. It can also terminate processes gracefully using SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL.

Quickstart & Demo
Follow these steps to set up and run the automated demo.

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/lnu-suite.git
cd lnu-suite

# 2. Set up the environment and build the tools
# The run.sh script handles venv creation, dependency installation, and C++ compilation.
chmod +x scripts/run.sh

# 3. Run the automated demo
./scripts/run.sh

The demo will:

Start the system monitor in the background.

Run a quick port scan on localhost.

(On Linux) List the top 20 processes using the C++ tool.

Wait for the monitor to finish and report completion.

Output logs can be found in the logs/ directory.

Manual Usage
Monitor
# Monitor system for 60 seconds with a 5-second interval
python3 lnu/monitor.py --interval 5 --duration 60 --out logs/monitor.log

Scan
# Scan a host for common ports and save the report
python3 lnu/scan.py --host 127.0.0.1 --start 1 --end 1024 --workers 200 --timeout 0.4 --output logs/scan.json

Process Manager (Linux Only)
# Build the binary first (done by run.sh)
g++ -std=gnu++17 cpp/lnu_proc.cpp -o bin/lnu-proc

# List processes
./bin/lnu-proc list

# Kill a process by its PID
./bin/lnu-proc kill <pid>

Design Notes
Concurrency: The port scanner uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to handle I/O-bound socket connections concurrently, making it significantly faster than a sequential scan.

Systems Programming: The C++ lnu-proc utility was written to demonstrate low-level systems knowledge by directly interfacing with the Linux /proc filesystem and using POSIX signals for process management.

Automation: The run.sh script serves as a robust entry point, ensuring the project is idempotent and easy to set up for any user.
